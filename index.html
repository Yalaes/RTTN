        <h3>F.A.Q</h3>
        <div class="faq-wrap">
            <div class="bar">On launch, I receive the message "A stalker call of pripyat installation has not been detected ...... requires you to own a valid copy of GSC game world's stalker call of pripyat?"</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>The engine on which Road To The North is build looks for a stalker call of pripyat cd key on launch. This check is still present to prevent piracy and to support GSC game world, the creator of the original stalker series. A digital Call of Pripyat key can be bought around 4 euros on for example G2A, and is also available on steam. If you already own Call of Pripyat, install it once so the cd key is registered on your PC. Road To The North does not require any of the original games, only the CoP cd key should be present in the registry.</p>
            </div>
          
            <div class="bar">MSCVP***.dll is missing?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>install Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable..</p>
            </div>
          
            <div class="bar">My character is dying and I don't know why?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Probably radiation. Avoid some areas untill you have a gas mask and filter. use the geiger counter item to see your radiation value. Your character will lose health because of radiation. eat clean food sources, drink water, smoke cigarettes, anything that has the lower radiation effect. don't forget to eat and sleep well.</p>
            </div>
          
            <div class="bar">Where do I go, in what order?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Missions unlock while you progress. Start with the Skadovsk mission. The PDA, self writing journal and dialogs provide enough information. You may choose your own order of progressing through the missions, the game will react to it. One of the first missions where you join a hunter may not be failed, or the story ends.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bar">Gonta is stuck, crouching at a wooden crate in the hunting mission?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A mutant should show up. Kill it and complete the mission. This mission may not fail. Sometimes the mutant doesn't show up as intended, might need to clear the area before going on this mission.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bar">My inventory icons are bugged/stretched/missing and I didn't mod anything myself?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p> in video options, increase the texture detail slider and (in some cases) switch to another dx(10/11) setting. The problem seems to be related to low graphics settings, or old hardware. For modders: keep the ui_icon_equipment.dds size low and export with DXT1. a 4k DXT5 file caused this issue for me on a high end system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bar">Crashes!</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p> send me a private message with your issue, so I can check if I need to make a patch for something. The mod is very stable. Keep in mind that high video settings like full grass distance, or making changes to the mod yourself are often the cause. Try lowering the lighting distance/grass distance for example before posting a crash report.</p>
